In March of 2017, we opened our new 8,000 square foot studio called 599 on the west side of midtown Manhattan. 599 is an architectural and programmatic instantiation of a digital library in physical space: we offer tools and resources that empower our members to read, write, and participate on the web. More specifically, our activities are focused on the digitization, description, and presentation of cultural heritage materials. 599 makes the labor and the communities associated with archiving and preservation visible, legible, and accessible; the space itself is a platform for action so that participants can organize to create their own community narratives. 

599 is launching with five service points: a digital forensics station, an imaging station, a recording station, an audio / video transfer station, and a graphic output / print station. Weâ€™ll be adding more specifics about our equipment and its availability here soon, so stay in touch!

##Graphic Output / Print Station

We have a [Graphtec CE6000 vinyl plotter](http://www.graphtecamerica.com/graphtec-america-products-cutting-plotters-ce6000-4060120-professional-performance) that is available for our members to make high quality, professional decals for exhibits, displays, and countless other uses. Because this is a new service, we have a limited supply of vinyl in 10 different colors that we can make available to you for free. Moving forward, vinyl will be available for a fee, or you can bring your own material as long as it fits the correct specifications for this machine.
